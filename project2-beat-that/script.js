//----------REQUIREMENTS------------//
// 1) there are 2 players and players take turnns
// 2) when a player clicks submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls, for example 3 and 6.
// 3) the player picks the order of the dice they want. For example, if they wanted the number 63, they would specify that the second dice goes first
// 4) After both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wins.
//----------PROBLEMS BREAKDOWN AND PLANNING-----------//
// ver 1: rolls 2 dice and turns the output for 1 player. That player chooses the dice order and get the correct return output.
// ver 2: refactor code to include player 2
//    - global variables for currentPlayer; allPlayersScore
//    - refactor outputMessages to interact with each, player 1 and 2
//    - write logic for player 1 to go first and then player 2, and finally point towards comparing score

// ver 3: implement comparing dice scores and declare winner
// ver 4. reset the game so that the players can play continually without refreshing the browser page
